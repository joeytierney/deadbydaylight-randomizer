## About

Tired of playing as the same character? Do you already have all perks unlocked? Do you need a new challenge? Want to try some perks you never used before? **Then is this the project you searched for**. This will randomly select either your Killer, Survivor, your four Killer perks or your four Survivor Perks to use in a game of Dead by Daylight.

## The Game
[Dead by Daylight](https://deadbydaylight.com/) is an asymmetrical multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed.
